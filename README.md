# LeetCode_Test_Assignment
This repository contains my LeetCode Test Assignment for the position of Content Creator / Technical Writer at LeetCode. In this, I have explained my intuition to two Medium Level problem and wrote  very neat and clean code in Java with useful comments. As first problem is Dynamic Programming problem, so I explained how we can reduced these different problems to there parent problems. Also I am thinking of writing solutions to more problems and I will make changes as per LeetCode instructions.

## Problems
 1. **LC: 416 Partition Equal Subset Sum:-**  [My Intuition & Code Explanation:](https://github.com/Jagrit29/LeetCode_Test_Assignment/tree/master/LC-416%20Partition-equal-subset-sum)
    <br>
    ([Problem Link to LC](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-equal-subset-sum/) )
 2. **LC: 515 Find Largest Value in Each Tree Row:-** [My Intuition & Code Explanation](https://github.com/Jagrit29/LeetCode_Test_Assignment/tree/master/LC-515.%20Find%20Largest%20Value%20in%20Each%20Tree%20Row)
    <br>
    ([Problem Link to LC](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-largest-value-in-each-tree-row/) )
    <br>

   
   I explained the intuition and approach to each problem in separate file and also explained it with code. For making it easier for users,    I have also created another file which contains code with useful comments. **I explained everything in following steps:**
   <br>
          1. Type of Problem: (How to recognise type of problem) <br>
          2. Understanding the problem statement. <br>
          3. Approach <br>
          4. Code     <br>
          5. Time & Space Complexity.  <br>
    

### Thanks
It would be really great opportunity for me to be small part of LeetCode community as I really admire the platform and website of LeetCode makes it different from all. As I have experience in Full Stack Development, I can understand how much hardwork and creativity LeetCode admins have shown.
Thank you.
