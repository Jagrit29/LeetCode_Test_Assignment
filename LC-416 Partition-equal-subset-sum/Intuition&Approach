Problem: LC-416 Partition Equal Subset Sum
Given a non-empty array containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets 
such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

Example 1:
Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].

Example 2:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 5]
Output: false
Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.


Approach:-

**1. Type of Problem:**
   As by reading the statement, it seems little tough to recognise any pattern but Subset Sum problem is basic Dynamic
   programming problem and we can think in that way. Now As We can choose any elements from array given and add them to either Subset 1 or
   Subset 2. So Basically we have choices, and whenever we have choices, we can think of Dynamic Programming.
